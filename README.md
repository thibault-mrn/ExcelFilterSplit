# ExcelFilterSplit
R package

This package will help you create multiple filtered Excel/CSV files. Filtering is made by choosing a column ; one output file per unique value of the selected column (not case sensitive ; not sensitive to accents).

Output files are compressed into a Zip folder. The file will be export into your current working directory.
